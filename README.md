# Dotfile utility

Currently trying `chezmoi`, but it is super annoying with its permission handling...
Looking for alternatives.
`chezmoi` has some nice sides, but it is misguidedly trying to use naming conventions
for file permission management...
You end up with silly `private_` prefixes everywhere in a **public** repo, the irony 😅
I also dislike the `dot_` renaming convention, it feels unnecessary.
